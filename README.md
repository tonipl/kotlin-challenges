# Multiples of 3 or 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

Another example, but with numbers below 20:

    Multiple of 3: 3 6 9 12 15 18
    Multiple of 5: 5 10 15
    Sum: 3 5 6 10 9 15 12 18 = 78
